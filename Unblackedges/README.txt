The program unblackedges takes at most one argument:

If an argument is given, it should be the name of a portable bitmap file (in pbm format).
If no argument is given, unblackedges reads from standard input, which should contain a portable bitmap.
If more than one argument is given, unblackedges halts with an error message (on stderr).
If a portable bitmap is promised but not delivered, unblackedges should halt with some sort of error message (on stderr).
