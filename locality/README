This is the README file for the arith assignment
by Mingzhe Li (mli04) and Mengtian Li (mli09), 10/15/14

We would like to acknowledge the help that we have received from Professor
Noah Mendelsohn, TAs: Ali Tai, Alex Tong, Jacob Gerace, Thomas Colgrove,
and online instructions from Professor Norman Ramsey.

Disclaimer:
        Everything works well, enjoying a data loss rate <3% at denominator
        of 255.

        Valgrind reports no memory leak or still reachable.

Architecture:
        We pretty much followed our design.

        -compression:
                This part reads in an image of proper ppm format. The image
                will be trimmed, if necessary, to even number of rows and 
                columns of pixels, because otherwise the image would not be
                able to get divided evenly into 2*2 blocks.  Then the image 
                is scanned through and mapped into 2*2 blocks. Each block will
                be packed into a 32-bit codeword.  After the entire image
                being compressed, the program prints the compressed data to
                standard output in COMP40 compressed image format.

        -decompression:
                This part of the program reads in compressed image in COMP40
                compressed image format.  It unpacks each codeword to a 2*2
                block of pixels.  After all the codeword being unpacked, a
                ppm object will hold the decompressed image,  which will be
                printed out to standard output.
