UM profiling
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acknowledgement:
	All TA that helps especially Kabir and Raewyn
Disclaimers:
	The final stage of my UM spends about 40% time on calling Seq_get. This
	is written by Hanson and I tried several times to write my own 
	polymorphic Seq_T but run out of time to make it work. Besides this, 
	Other code are well optimized.
	Since I already met the performance goal for profiling, I stopped here.
	If I were given more time, I would fix how to write my own Sequence.
Time:
	3 hours to analyze
	8 hours spent on solving
